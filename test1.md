Discuss – Why is the program not behaving as expected on the test file you wrote? How could you fix it?
Error - Leaving an empty line after the last link leads to an infinite loop
Work as a group on fixing the program so that:
The original test still has the same output (the one the programmer initially tried)
The broken test you wrote has correct output
When you’ve updated the program to work on both of these cases, make a commit that should have just the changes to the .java file required to make it pass.
